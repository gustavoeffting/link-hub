● Did you use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)? If so, how?
Yes, Claude. As it was a simple implementation and I decided to stick with the core features, I didn't need to use Cursor agent neither the autocomplete. I just used Claude to help me to configurate Supabase (I never used before) and to find the right classes for Tailwind.
● What did you build or decide manually?
Supabase was a suggestion from Claude, because my first though was to use just a local JSON file to handle this. But Claude showed that it was faster to implement Supabase and it would help with the authentication part. The rest was built manually.
● Where did you need to think critically or make decisions beyond AI suggestions?
Even with this good suggestion about Supabase, I searched about it on web, youtube and asked for some developer friends if they had already used it to give some feedback. About the design as well, I searched not just for Linktree website, but also in the concurrents to get some inspiration.
● What would you improve with more time?
With more time, I would implement:
  - add picture for avatar profile
  - mobile improvements for dashboard
  - regex validation/autocomplete for links
  - custom theming
  - analytics
  - Motion for animations
